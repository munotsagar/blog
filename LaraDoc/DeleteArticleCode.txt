rying on my own to Delete an Article - here is the controller:
public function destroy($article)
{
$article->tags()->detach();
$article->delete();
Session::flash('message','Article was deleted');
return redirect('articles');
}

and here is the Delete button on show.blade.php page. It needs to be within its own form (weird)

{!! Form::open(['method' => 'DELETE', 'route'=> ['articles.destroy', $article->id]]) !!}
{!! Form::submit ('Delete Article', ['class' => 'btn btn-danger']) !!}
{!! Form::close() !!}

Hope this helps anyone wanting to add this feature to the tutorial. And thanks Jeffrey Way!
