		generate:model               Generate a model

		generate:resource            Generate a new resource
		generate:scaffold            Scaffold a new resource (with boilerplate)
		generate:seed                Generate a database table seeder
		generate:view                Generate a view


after make changes in create table for adding required columns then fire below commands :

	php artisan make:migration add_excert_to_articles_table --table="articles"
	
	 php artisan migrate:rollback (To rollback sql changes)
	

2 php artisan migrate

3 Perform a composer update, then composer dump-autoload

composer dump-autoload

If the above doesn't solve the problem, change the classmap in your composer.json file such that it contains the project-relative path to your php files:

"autoload-dev": {
    "classmap": [
        "tests/TestCase.php",
        "database/seeds/UserTableSeeder.php" //include the file with its path here
    ]
}, /** ... */

and soon after, perform a composer dump-autoload, and it should work now like a breeze!

4 Generate Controller Command

	php artisan make:controller PagesController (it will include all the methods in PagesController.php file)
	
	php artisan make:controller contactController --plain
	
5 Help Command

	php artisan help make:controller
	

6 php artisan migrate:rollback	

7 composer require doctrine/dbal

8 php artisan make:model Articles

9 php artisan tinker - laravel command line editor
	
	We can execute command like :
	
			$article = App\Articles::create(['title' => 'New Article', 'body' => 'New Body']);
			
	Fetch All the data :
		
			App\Articles::all()->__toString();
			
	Find the particuler record 

			$article	=	App\Articles::find(2);
			
			$article->__toString();
			
			$article->body = "Updated";
			
			$article->save();
			
			$article->update(['title' => 'Again New Article', 'body' => 'Again New Body']);
